1. The first thing that you are going to want to do is install git and vim with:
   "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git vim"
(Note this will have to be done on bothRaspberry Pi's)

2. Next we will use the instructions from this link in order to get a piece of software working that will read temperature and humidity from the temp/humd sensor.
(Note this will have to be done on both Raspberry Pi's)

   "git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git"
   "cd Adafruit_Python_DHT"
   "sudo apt-get update"
   "sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl"
   "sudo python setup.py install"

3. Next run the following commands on the master Raspberry Pi node (the one you decide to be the webserver host)
   "sudo pip install flask"
   "sudo pip install GPIO"

4. Next get the webserver from Git using the following command:
   "git clone ............."***

5. Next we will make several changes in the webserver file
   1. First

6. Now we will make several changes on the slave node****
