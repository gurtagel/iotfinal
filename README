1. The first thing that you are going to want to do is install git and vim with:
   "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git vim"
(Note this will have to be done on bothRaspberry Pi's)

2. Next we will use the instructions from this link in order to get a piece of software working that will read temperature and humidity from the temp/humd sensor.
(Note this will have to be done on both Raspberry Pi's)

   "git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git"
   "cd Adafruit_Python_DHT"
   "sudo apt-get update"
   "sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl"
   "sudo python setup.py install"

3. Next run the following commands on the master Raspberry Pi node (the one you decide to be the webserver host)
   "sudo pip install flask"
   "sudo pip install GPIO"

4. Next get the webserver from Git using the following command:
   "git clone https://github.com/gurtagel/iotfinal.git"

5. Now enable passwordless ssh from the master to slave node:
   "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <SLAVE_HOSTNAME>@<SLAVE_IP_ADDR>"

5. Next we will make several changes in the webserver file
   1. First on lines 15 and 19, change the GPIO pin for the sound sensor to whichever you are using (in our case we are using pin 17)
   2. Next on line 110, we have hardcoded the location of the Adafruit temperature driver. Change it depending on where you cloned it to. 
      In our case it was in ../Adafruit_Python_DHT/examples/AdafruitDHT.py. 
   3. On the same line, we hardcoded the GPIO pin for the temp/humd sensor to 4, change this to where you have it.
   4. On line 119, change the hostname and ip address for the slave node to whatever your respective device's hostname and ip are.
      In addition, change the location of the Adafruit installation on this same line like you did in step 2.
      Also, on that same line, change the GPIO pin from 2 to whichever pin you installed it on the slave device.

6. At this point, you should be able to type in the terminal "python server.py"; now by navigating to "127.0.0.1:5000" you should see the website.
